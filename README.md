# Acuity
Acuity is a web application that allows users to enter their current symptoms and assess if they should:

 1. Treat from home
 2. Go to urgent care
 3. Go to the ER

Once the acuity of the person has been reported, the user will have the option to put in their zip code to quickly find the nearest urgent care or emergency room.

## Problem
Especially with the rise of the COVID-19 pandemic, emergency rooms and urgent cares have been at their workload limit. These service centers are receiving a surplus of patients. Not all of these patients are experiencing health issues that require and ER or urgent care visit, contribuiting to the stress and wait times present at these facilities.

## Our Solution
A website the quickly allows user to decide how severe their current symptoms are and if they require a visit to the emergency room, urgent care, or their local pharmacy to treat at home. Our desire is to reduce the stress on the current health care community.
